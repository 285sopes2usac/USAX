==========

This directory contains C files directly built as part of the `devshell`
user app, containing usax's system tests. In order words, these tests use
kernel's only interface (syscalls) in order to check its correctness.
The reason for keeping those files here instead of in userapps/devshell/ is
purely organizational: it just makes more sense to have ALL of usax's test
in a single (master) directory called `tests`. The non-test part of devshell
clearly should remain in the userapps/ directory.

NOTE: for info about to run those tests, see the main README.md file.

DON'T FORGET: to add a new system test, add an entry in `cmds_table.h`.

Other
======

The subdirectory `runners` contain high-level python scripts used to run
those system tests in QEMU VMs.
