This directory contains special test headers, where STATIC kernel functions
are declared. STATIC kernel functions are functions that are static only when
the real kernel is compiled, while they turn to regular functions when the
kernel is compiled as a static library for unit tests.

The reason for having such headers and including the both in the kernel's and
in the unit tests' code is to make impossible to have a function signature
mismatch without breaking the build.
